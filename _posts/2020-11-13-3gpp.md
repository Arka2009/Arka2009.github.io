1. Important Reading Resources
    1. [PHY trace generator IMDEA-OWL (Forked)][phyTraceGen]
    2. [LTE UE Category][lteUECat]
    3. [BSR values][bsr]
    4. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/impact-open-source-mobile-security-research-roger-piqueras-jover/

2. Mapping between commercial standard names and their 3GPP rel spec
    1. Long term evolution (LTE) ---> Releases 8 and 9
    2. LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) ---> Releases 10 to 12
    3. LTE-Advanced Pro (LTE-A Pro) ---> Releases 13 and 14
    4. 5G NR ---> Releases 15 onwards

3. 5G Hardware Products
    1. [Intel 5G products/solutions][Intel5g]
    2. [Cadence][cadence5g]
    3. [COTS-SDR][cots]
    4. [SiFive (U74-MC)][sifive5g]

4. 3GPP core skills
    3. 3GPP radio access networks protocol stack (with a focus on L1-L3)
    4. E2E network architectures
    5. TCP/IP networking protocols
    6. Cloud-RAN, network function virtualization, data analytics
    7. Dynamic, time-driven, system-level simulations
    8. Machine learning techniques and related tools
    9. Experience of ML/AI/DL working in a successful project with referred deliverables
    10. RF Propagation and hands-on experience with ray tracing tools (e.g. WinProp, Wireless Insight)
    11. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and associated software (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS, etc)
    12. C++ profiling tools (Valgrind, GProf, LLVM, etcâ€¦)
    13. LFS or Grid Engine as a Linux farm job scheduling environment
    14. Mobility Management and Beamforming
    15. Heterogenous Parallel Computing (CUDA, openMP)

5. 3GPP open source implementation
    1. [LTE receiver using GNU Radio][lte-gr]
    2. [srsLTE][completeLTE] : A complete open source 3GPP rel-10 aligned SDR implementation from IP to PHY layer
    3. [Open LTE based on GNU-radio][openLTE]

6. HARQ and Error Correcting Codes
    1. Ch5 of [HSPA Evolution][hspa-book]
    2. Error correcting codes [Fundamentals of Error-Correcting Codes][ec]

7. CRAN with processing constraints (uvHPF work important notes)
    1. Check chapter-3 of [CRAN Book][cran-book]. It describes the notion of
       computation outage which is very similar to deadline miss ratio/drop rate in my case. 
       While their treatment is more geared towards MCS and computation limitations due
       to iterative decoding. However its a worth a read.
