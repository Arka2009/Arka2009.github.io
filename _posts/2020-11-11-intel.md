1. Tools from Intel
     1.  [Workload Colocation Agent][wca] for interference management on hosts/nodes
     2. [Platform Resource Manager][prm] useful for building contention models based on utilization data.
     3. [Intel Middleware-metering][imm]
     4. [Intel RDT][rdt]
     5. [LMBench][lmb] microbenchmarks for microarchitectural analyses

2. [Brendan Gregg Blog][bgregg] on performance analyses and eBPF

3. 3rd party tools for reading and writing PMC/MSR
    1. [Power consumption][power-hpc-servers] on HPC servers.
    2. [opcm][opcm] maintained by Intel engineers, is one of the best known PMC/MSR manipulation tools out there. Source code is readable and simple, documentation is good and provides an exporter for Prometheus.
    3. [likwid][likwid] yet another PMC manipulation tool. Nothing particularly impressive about it. 
    4. [Jd Mccalpin][jdm] tools is simple and explanatory for reading and writing raw PMC/MSR. RAW MSR/PMC values require significant decoding to make them friendly for human consumption.
    5. The highly outdated [Intel power gadget][intel-power]
 
4. PMC and MSR Description. And what to do about their values
    1. [Event and MSR description table][intel-msr-list]
    2. [Top-Down Microarchitectural Analyses][TMAM]
    3. [Tuning Guides and Performance Analysis Papers][tuning]

5. Power and Thermal Management
    1. [ACPI][acpi]
    2. [Python Power Mgmt][pypower] 
    3. [Powergov][Powergov] 
    4. [ThermalD][ThermalD]
    5. A detailed discussion of [C States and P states][pcstates] (best I have seen)
    6. [Linux ACPI][linuxACPI]

6. x86-64 Dynamic Binary Analyses Tools/Framework
    1. SDM [sdm] for dynamic flop count on x86-64 architectures

7. Cloud Computing Load Balancers
     7.1 Prometheus, Kubernetes etc and corresponding books (https://jamesturnbull.net/#books)
